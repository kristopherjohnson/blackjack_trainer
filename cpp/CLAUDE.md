This is a C++ translation of a Python blackjack strategy trainer program.

The Python version is in the parent directory.

See @../blackjack_trainer_plan.md for the specifications of the Python program.

See @../blackjack_basic_strategy.md for the strategy table.

Do not make any changes to files in the parent directory when doing work on the
C++ translation.

If asked to run pre-commit checks, do the following:

1. Run clang-format on all C++ files in the `include/`, `src/`, and `tests/` directories.
2. Compile with `-Wall` and fix any warnings.
3. Run all unit tests.
4. Ensure that the README.md file contains up-to-date instructions for building and running the program and unit tests
