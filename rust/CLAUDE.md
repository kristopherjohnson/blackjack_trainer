This is a Rust translation of a Python blackjack strategy trainer program.

The Python version is in the parent directory.

See @../blackjack_trainer_plan.md for the specifications of the Python program.

See @../blackjack_basic_strategy.md for the strategy table.

Do not make any changes to files in the parent directory when doing work on the
Rust translation.

If asked to run pre-commit checks, do the following:

1. Run `cargo format` on all Rust files in this directory and subdirectories.
2. Run `cargo clippy` on all Rust files in this directory and subdirectories.
3. Run all unit tests.
4. Ensure that the README.md file contains up-to-date instructions for building and running the program and unit tests
